<h1>cryptograpghy</h1>
<p align="justify">Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.
 More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in 
information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation
are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, and 
communication science. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, 
and military communications.</p>
<p align="justify">Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into unintelligible text (called ciphertext). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that create the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and in each instance by a "key". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a short string of characters, which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext. Formally, a "cryptosystem" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms which correspond to each key. Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes. </p>
